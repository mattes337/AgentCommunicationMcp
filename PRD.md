# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Agent Communication System using Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Multi-Agent Communication System leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable autonomous AI agents/LLMs to collaborate on software development projects while maintaining independence over their respective codebases. Each agent manages its own development context, memory, and task queue through file-based storage, while communicating and coordinating with other agents via MCP services. The system prioritizes rapid deployment and productivity through simple file-based data persistence.

## 2. Problem Statement

Current AI agent/LLM systems operate in isolation, making it difficult to:
- Coordinate complex multi-component software projects across multiple AI agents
- Share context and knowledge between specialized LLM agents
- Maintain autonomous operation while enabling seamless collaboration
- Track dependencies and communication between different AI-driven development streams
- Ensure AI-produced software components work together seamlessly
- Provide persistent memory and context to LLM agents across sessions

## 3. Solution Overview

The MCP-based system provides:
- **File-Based Agent Memory**: Each agent maintains context and tasks as simple files for immediate productivity
- **MCP Service Integration**: Leverages Model Context Protocol for LLM agent communication
- **Autonomous LLM Operation**: AI agents work independently on their codebases with persistent context
- **Dependency Management**: Clear consumer-producer relationships between AI agents
- **Task Coordination**: File-based request-response mechanism for cross-agent collaboration
- **Rapid Deployment**: Simple file storage enables immediate system deployment and testing

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1 LLM Agent Structure
Each AI agent in the system consists of:
- **Agent ID**: Unique identifier for the LLM agent
- **Context Memory**: Markdown file containing agent's knowledge, state, and learned information
- **Task Queue**: File-based ordered list of tasks with priorities and dependencies
- **Codebase**: The software project the AI agent is responsible for developing
- **Consumer Relationships**: List of AI agents that depend on this agent's output
- **Producer Relationships**: List of AI agents this agent depends on
- **MCP Service**: Model Context Protocol service for LLM communication

### 4.2 File-Based Memory System
```
Agent Memory Structure (File-Based for Rapid Deployment):

## 5. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Communication

### 5.1 MCP-Based Task Request Flow
1. **LLM Agent A** identifies need for functionality from **LLM Agent B**
2. **Agent A** creates a request task file with:
   - Clear requirements specification
   - Expected deliverables
   - Integration points
   - Timeline constraints
3. **Agent A** uses MCP service to notify **Agent B** of new request file
4. **Agent B** receives MCP notification and reads request file
5. **Agent B** processes request and creates implementation task files
6. **Agent B** uses MCP to send response file reference to **Agent A**
7. **Agent A** receives MCP notification and reads response file
8. Both agents update their context.md files with new information

### 5.2 MCP Message Types (File References)
- **TASK_REQUEST**: MCP notification pointing to request file for implementation or assistance
- **TASK_RESPONSE**: MCP notification pointing to response file for a previous request
- **STATUS_UPDATE**: MCP notification pointing to status file with progress updates
- **DEPENDENCY_NOTIFICATION**: MCP notification of dependency changes via file updates
- **INTEGRATION_TEST**: MCP notification pointing to integration test request file
- **COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION**: MCP notification of task completion with result file reference
- **CONTEXT_SYNC**: MCP notification for context.md file updates between related agents

## 6. Agent Relationships

### 6.1 Consumer-Producer Model
```
Example Architecture:
Frontend Agent (A) ←→ API Agent (B) ←→ Database Agent (C)
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
   Web App            REST API            Database Schema
```

- **Frontend Agent** consumes API Agent's services
- **API Agent** consumes Database Agent's services
- Each agent maintains autonomy over their implementation
- Clear interfaces defined between components

### 6.2 Relationship Types
- **Direct Dependency**: Agent A directly uses Agent B's output
- **Indirect Dependency**: Agent A depends on Agent B through Agent C
- **Bidirectional**: Agents have mutual dependencies
- **Optional**: Dependency is not critical for core functionality
