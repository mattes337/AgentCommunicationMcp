# Project Tasks

This file tracks the current tasks and development progress for the Agent Communication MCP project.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Agent Registration and Management
- [x] **Fix agent name reporting in MCP** - Augment now reports using the project name from package.json instead of hardcoded names
- [x] **Add task creator field to task structure** - Tasks now store the creator (created_by) separate from the responsible agent (agent_id)
- [x] **Prevent unnecessary agent re-registration** - Added forceUpdate parameter to control when agents should be re-registered

### Core Features
- [x] **Multi-Agent Communication System** - File-based communication system using MCP protocol
- [x] **Task Management** - Task creation, assignment, and tracking between agents
- [x] **Agent Relationships** - Producer/consumer and bidirectional relationships
- [x] **MCP Server Implementation** - Standard and shared MCP server implementations
- [x] **File-based Storage** - Agent data, tasks, and relationships stored in file system
- [x] **Docker Support** - Cross-platform Docker setup for development and testing

## Current Tasks ðŸ”„

### Documentation and Testing
- [ ] **Update documentation** - Reflect changes to task structure and registration behavior
- [ ] **Add integration tests** - Test the new forceUpdate functionality
- [ ] **Update examples** - Ensure examples use the new task creator field properly

### Bug Fixes and Improvements
- [ ] **Review related agent registration** - Ensure related agents are only registered when needed
- [ ] **Add task completion notifications** - Implement reply functionality to task creators
- [ ] **Improve error handling** - Better error messages for registration and task creation

## Future Enhancements ðŸš€

### Performance and Scalability
- [ ] **Optimize file I/O operations** - Batch operations and caching
- [ ] **Add agent discovery** - Automatic discovery of available agents
- [ ] **Implement task prioritization** - Better task scheduling and execution order

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Task dependencies** - Implement proper dependency resolution
- [ ] **Agent monitoring** - Health checks and status monitoring
- [ ] **Security enhancements** - Authentication and authorization for agents
- [ ] **Web UI** - Management interface for agents and tasks

### Integration
- [ ] **VS Code extension** - Better integration with development environment
- [ ] **CI/CD integration** - Automated testing and deployment
- [ ] **External tool integration** - Connect with project management tools

## Notes

### Task Structure Changes
The task structure now includes a `created_by` field to track who created the task, separate from the `agent_id` which indicates who is responsible for completing it. This enables proper reply functionality when tasks are completed.

### Agent Registration Changes
Agent registration now supports a `forceUpdate` parameter. By default, existing agents will not be re-registered unless explicitly requested. This prevents unnecessary overhead and maintains agent state.

### Development Guidelines
- Always check if an agent exists before registering
- Use the `created_by` field for task notifications and replies
- Test changes with both standard and shared MCP server configurations
- Update documentation when making structural changes
